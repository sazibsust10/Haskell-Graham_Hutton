1. Using library functions, define a function halve :: [a ] → ([a ], [a]) that
splits an even-lengthed list into two halves. For example:

Prelude > halve [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])


Answer:

Definition 1:

halve :: [a] -> [[a],[a]]
halve xs = (take ((length xs) / 2) xs, drop ((length xs) / 2) xs)


Definition 2:
halve :: [a] -> [[a],[a]]
halve xs = (take n xs, drop n xs)
			where n = div (length xs) 2
